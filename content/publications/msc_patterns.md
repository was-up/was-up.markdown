Every year, thousands of new students begin their Masters in STEM-related topics. Despite being regarded as a common occurrence by the faculty, it represents the culmination of years of studying and preparation for their professional life. Notwithstanding, these students face well-known recurrent problems: how to choose a topic, how to choose an advisor, how to start researching, and how to deal with all the unknowns associated with academic research. Although there are several books on how to write a thesis, most of them avoid prescriptive recommendations on topics beyond research \emph{per se} or focus on doctoral students, for which the duration and motivation are significantly different. In this paper, we draft a pattern language comprised of thirty patterns that we have observed from supervising over a hundred masters students within the last decade.
