*Live Programming* is an idea pioneered by programming environments from the earliest days of computing, such as those for Lisp and Smalltalk. One thing they had in common is *liveness*: an always accessible evaluation and nearly instantaneous feedback, usually focused on coding activities. In this paper, we argue for *Live Software Development (LiveSD)*, bringing liveness to software development activities beyond coding, to make software easier to visualize, simpler to understand, and faster to evolve. Multiple challenges may vary with the activity and application domain. Research on this topic needs to consider the more important liveness gaps in software development, which representations and abstractions better support developers, and which tools are needed to support it.
